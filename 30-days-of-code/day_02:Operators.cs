// Objective
// In this challenge, you will work with arithmetic operators. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video.

// Task
// Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip), and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost. Round the result to the nearest integer.

// Example



// A tip of 15% * 100 = 15, and the taxes are 8% * 100 = 8. Print the value  and return from the function.

// Function Description
// Complete the solve function in the editor below.

// solve has the following parameters:

// int meal_cost: the cost of food before tip and tax
// int tip_percent: the tip percentage
// int tax_percent: the tax percentage
// Returns The function returns nothing. Print the calculated value, rounded to the nearest integer.

// Note: Be sure to use precise values for your calculations, or you may end up with an incorrectly rounded result.

// Input Format

// There are  lines of numeric input:
// The first line has a double,  (the cost of the meal before tax and tip).
// The second line has an integer,  (the percentage of  being added as tip).
// The third line has an integer,  (the percentage of  being added as tax).

// Sample Input

// 12.00
// 20
// 8
// Sample Output

// 15
// Explanation

// We round  to the nearest integer and print the result, 15.
